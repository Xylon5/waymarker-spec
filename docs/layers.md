# Narrative Layers

Waymarker models narratives using three explicit layers.

## fact.* — Observation
Facts describe what was observed or derived from raw data.
They are time-bound and reproducible.

Examples:
- driving segments
- GPS stops
- scene changes

## interp.* — Interpretation
Interpretations assign semantic meaning to facts.
They represent hypotheses, not truth.

Examples:
- driving style
- environmental conditions
- safety assessments

## narr.* — Narrative Selection
Narratives select and structure events for presentation.
They are editorial and audience-dependent.
