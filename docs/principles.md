# Core Principles

## 1. Separation of Concerns
Waymarker strictly separates:
- observation (facts)
- interpretation (meaning)
- narration (editorial choice)

No layer may silently influence another.

## 2. Evidence First
Every interpretation must be explainable in terms of evidence.
Every narrative decision must reference facts or interpretations.

## 3. Time as the Primary Axis
All information is anchored on a common time axis.
Spatial, visual, or semantic meaning is secondary.

## 4. Explicit Uncertainty
Confidence and ambiguity are first-class citizens.
Waymarker prefers uncertainty over false precision.

## 5. Host and Vendor Neutrality
The specification does not assume:
- a specific application
- a database
- a programming language
- an execution environment
