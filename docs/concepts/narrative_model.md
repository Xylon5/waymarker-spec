# The Narrative Model

Waymarker treats a narrative as a **projection** over time.

Raw data (video, telemetry, audio) does not form a story.
A story emerges only when:
1. observations are identified,
2. meaning is inferred,
3. selections are made.

Waymarker enforces this process structurally.

A narrative is therefore not a claim of truth,
but a *traceable editorial construct*.
