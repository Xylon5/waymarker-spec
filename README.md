# Waymarker Specification

The Waymarker Specification defines an **open, vendor-neutral standard**
for representing *narratives derived from evidence over time*.

Waymarker is **not** a storytelling engine.
It is a framework for making *how stories are constructed from data*
transparent, explainable, and reproducible.

This repository contains:
- conceptual documentation
- normative rules and schemas
- examples of compliant exports

It intentionally contains **no implementation code**.
