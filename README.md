# Waymarker Specification

Waymarker is an open, explainable standard for deriving *narratives* from heterogeneous evidence
(video, audio, telemetry, documents, web sources).

This repository defines **schemas, type conventions, and architectural principles**.
It does **not** define implementations.

Core principles:
- Explainability over automation
- Evidence and uncertainty first
- Separation of fact, interpretation, and narrative
- Offline-first, host-agnostic design
